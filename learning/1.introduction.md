## Excel in Data Analysis
### 1. Data cleaning Mastery :
- remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats. Learn text-to-columns, find & replace techniques, adn data validation rules for pristine dataset

### 2. Pivot Table Excellence : 
- Summerize thousand of rows instantly. Master grouping, calculated files, slicers, and timeline filter to extract actionable insight from complex data

### 3. Advanced Formulas & Functions : 
- Deploy VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIFS, and array formulas. Automate calculations and create dynamic reports that update automatically

### 4. Dashboard Creation :
- Design professional dashboard combining charts, sparklines, and conditional formatting. Create interactive elements that tell your data story effectively

## Tableau : The Art of Storytelling
- Transform numbers into narratives. Tableau empowers you to create stunning visualization that communicate insight instantly and inspire actions

### 1. Connect Data Sources : 
- link multiple databases, spreadsheets, and cloud sources seamlessly 

### 2. Design Visualizations : 
- Create Bar Charts, heat maps, scatter plots and custom graphics

### 3. Add Interactivity : 
- Build Dynamic filters, parameters, and drill-down capabilities

### 4. Share Insights : 
- Publish dashboards and create compelling data stories for stakeholders

        1. Conntect Data Source -> 2. Design Visualization --> 3. Add Interactivity --> 4. Share Insight

## SQL + PowerBI in action
- Experience the complete pipeline : from raw databases queries to polished business intelligent dashboards that drive strategic decision.

### 1. Extract Data with SQL :
- Write optimized queries to pull relevant data from multiple tables and databases efficiently

### 2. Clean & Transform : 
- Apply data cleansing rules, handle null values, and reshape data structure for analysis.

### 3. Build Data Models : 
- Create relationships between tables, establish hierarchies, and define calculated columns in PowerBI

### 4. Design Visualization :
- Select appropriate chart types, apply color schemes, and implement interactive filtering mechanism.

### 5. Generate Insight : 
- Analyze patterns, identify trends, and present actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

## Real World Applications :
