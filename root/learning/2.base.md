## Types of Data
- Structured: Organized in rows and columns. (ex:SQL, Excel)
- Unstructured: No predefined formats. (ex: Text, Images, Videos)
- Semi-Structured: Contains tags but no rigid structure. (ex: JSON, XML)

## The Four Types of Data Analysis:

1. Descriptive Analysis:
    - summerizing historical data to understand what happened.
    - ex: a monthly sales report tells a 10% sales drop.
    - key stats: mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
2. Diagnostic Analysis:
    - drilling down to find the root cause to understand why it happened.
    - ex: Discovering the sales drop was caused by a server outage in the East Coast region.
    - key stats: correlation analysis, drill down discovery.
3. Predictive Analysis:
    - using historical patterns to predict what will happen next.
    - ex: Forecasting that sales will drop another 5% next month if the server isn't fixed.
    - key stats: regression, forecasting, probability.
4. Prescriptive Analysis:
    - suggesting the best course of action to answer what we should do
    - ex: An algorithm automatically rerouting web traffic to healthy servers to prevent sales loss.
    - key stats: optimization algorithms, simulation

# Big Data
### when the data becomes too large for Excel or standard databases to handle, it enters the realm of Big Data.
## The Five V's of Big Data:
1. Volume: The sheer amount of data. (Terabytes, Petabytes)
2. Velocity: The speed at which data is generated. (eg: streaming data from sensors or stock markets)
3. Variety: The different types of data. (Structured SQL tables vs. unstructured tweets/images/videos)
4. Veracity: The trustworthiness of data. (The accuracy of the data, is it accurate or fake? is it noisy?)
5. Value: The potential business worth of the data. (data is useless unless it drives value)
